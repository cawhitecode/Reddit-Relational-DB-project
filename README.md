# Reddit-Relational-DB-project

If you're looking for a how to setup. I'll include a short how to under "howto.md"</br>
</br>
This project is used to practice Python and SQL together.</br>
The purpose of this project was to get a better understandment of Reddit and what controls their engagement. The hypothesis that the amount of comments per a submission drives the upvote counter higher, thus to the front page. I was also curious on which titles or words were most often on each subreddit on the /r/all.</br>
</br>
## Reasoning:
</br>
The question comes up, I have this cool idea and want to spread this idea far and wide. Which subreddit do I choose? Which wording do I go with and which do I avoid? Do you want to focus on the most comment engagment to drive conversation or do you just want some time to shine on the front page of reddit? Maybe a mix of all of the above? With the right data we can give answers to all these...
</br>
The intial answer well answer together is what drivers most upvotes? Is it the amount of comments, maybe subreddit, or subscribers? Most likely a mix of all three, but I went we with a hypothesis that comments drives the amount of upvotes higher. Thus what's the ratio of upvotes and comments per each subreddit? We will need a few bits of **data:**</br>
</br>
*1. The title</br>*
*2. Subreddit</br>*
*3. Number of Upvotes</br>*
*4. Number of Comments</br>*
*5. Number of Subscribers</br>*
</br>
also grab what is the 'rank' of each submission when we pull our data
